	 <t>   This memo presents a proposal for an efficient and simple way of 
   forming email addresses.  The goal is to achieve easier, more 
   productive communication between email users, in particular by aking 
   addresses intuitive and thus easy to remember, or guess-enabled on 
   material-world data about the correspondent, as well as independent 
   from technical or organizational specifics of email services.
